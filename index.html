                <h2> Introduction</h2> <br> &emsp; Join the global movement of young leaders who developing innovative solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges. Rotaract clubs bring together people ages 18 and older to exchange ideas with leaders
                in the community, develop leadership and professional skills, and have fun through service. <br><br> &emsp;Rotaract originally began as a Rotary International youth program in 1968 at Charlotte North Rotary Club in Charlotte, North Carolina,
                United States, and has grown into a major organization of over 10,904 clubs spread around the world and over 203,000 members in 189 countries. It is a service, leadership, professional and community service organization (often miscommunicated
                as a Social Service Club) for young men and women between the ages 18 and over. Rotaract focuses on the development of young adults as leaders in their communities and workplaces. Clubs around the world also take part in international
                service projects, in a global effort to bring peace and international understanding to the world.
                <br><br> &emsp;"Rotaract" stands for "Rotary in Action", although the name originally comes from a combination of "Rotary" and "Interact" (International + Action), the high school level program created by Rotary International in 1962.
                Most Rotaract activities take place at the club level. Rotaract clubs hold formal meetings in person or virtually, usually every two weeks, which feature speakers, special outings, social activities, discussions or visits to other clubs.
                Club members get together on designated days for service project work, social events, or professional/leadership development workshops. <br><br> &emsp;To be eligible for membership, prospective members must be 18 years of age and over,
                show that they are committed to Rotaract, and show that they are of good standing in the community. After being approved by the club, prospective members are 'inducted' to become members, also known as 'Rotaractors'. The avenues of service
                include Club Service, Community Service, International Service and Professional Development. Rotaract Club undertake various projects for the overall development of their members. <br><br> &emsp; In 2019, Rotaract went from being a program
                of Rotary International to being a membership type of Rotary International, elevating its status to resemble that of Rotary clubs. As of 1 July 2020, Rotaract clubs can exist on their own, or may be sponsored by Rotary and/or Rotaract
                clubs. This makes them true "partners in service" and key members of the family of Rotary. A Rotaract club may, but is not required to, establish upper age limits, provided that the club (in accordance with its bylaws) obtain the concurrence
                of its members and the sponsor club(s) (if sponsored). In Hong Kong， there are 8 U-based universities joint to organize an annual camp for the committee members to participate. The camp is called Interflow.
